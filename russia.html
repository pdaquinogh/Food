    <h2>Simple Pelmeni Recipe</h2>
    <div class = "Simple Pelmeni Recipe-text">
        <p2> Ingredients:<br>

            For the Dough:<br>
            
            2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
            1/2 cup water<br>
            1 large egg<br>
            1/2 teaspoon salt<br>

            For the Filling:<br>
            
            1/2 pound ground beef<br>
            1/2 pound ground pork<br>
            1 medium onion, finely chopped<br>
            Salt and pepper to taste<br>
            2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)<br>
            
            For Serving:<br>
            
            Sour cream<br>
            Fresh herbs (such as dill or parsley), chopped<br>
            
            Instructions:<br>
            
            Make the Dough:<br>
            
            In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Make a well in the center, add the egg and water, and mix to combine. Knead until the dough is smooth and elastic. Cover with a cloth and let rest for 30 minutes.<br>
            
            Prepare the Filling:<br>
            
            In another bowl, combine the ground beef, ground pork, chopped onion, garlic (if using), salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly.<br>
           
            Form the Pelmeni:<br>
            
            Roll out the dough on a floured surface until thin. Using a glass or cookie cutter, cut out circles.<br>
            Place a small amount of filling in the center of each circle. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Press the edges to seal, then bring the two corners together and pinch to make a rounded dumpling shape.<br>
            
            Cook the Pelmeni:<br>
            
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pelmeni in batches, stirring gently to prevent sticking. Cook until they float to the surface and the dough is tender, about 3 to 5 minutes.<br>
            
            Serve:<br>
            
            Serve hot with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of fresh herbs.</p2>
