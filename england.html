    <h2> Victoria Sponge</h2>
    <div class = "intro">
    <p> The Victoria Sponge is a cake asscoiated with Queen Victoria, a queen who had a sweet tooth!<br>
    It was thought that this cake was a favourite of the Queen. <br>
    However, there is claims that it started in the nursery. In the early Victorian period, afternoon tea consisted of seed and fruit cake.<br>
    For safety reasons, it was belived that these were not suitable cakes for young children <br>
    So a light and <i> harmless</i> cake was prepared as a teatime treat for them instead, the Victoria Sponge!<br>
    Only later did this cake make its way to the adult table.<br>
